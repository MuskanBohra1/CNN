# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to perform binary image classification. The model is trained to classify images based on visual features it learns from the dataset.
